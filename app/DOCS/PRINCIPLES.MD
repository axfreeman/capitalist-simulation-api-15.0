# Principles of this project
## The Community Principle
The purpose is to create a community of people that want to understand what markets really do.
## The Common Language principle
* The most basic need of a community is to communicate
* This needs a language
* This language is the API
### Separation of concerns
In line with almost universal modern(2024) design principles:  
* What you see is what you choose to see.  
* What you do is what you choose to do.  
* There are two fundamentally distinct components of a simulation:
** The simulation itself
** The display of the results
* They speak to each other via an API
### No unnecessary barriers to understanding
* Barriers arise from specialisation and expertise.  
* The duty of an expert is to make other experts.  
## The practice and theory principle
Simulations involve two sets of expertise
* The economics   
* The technology   
* The technology has to inform the economics  
* The economics has to inform the technology  
## The 'Anyone Can' Principle
TBA

## The 'Not locked in' Principle
* The base software should be as widely used as possible.  
* Preference to the size of the user community, not how cool the software is.  
## The 'Oh I see" Principle
* Newbie users should be able to follow the code.  
* The code should make clear what the writer is trying to do.  
* This includes inline documentation.  
## The Functionality versus Transparency principle
* The first principle is that this is not easy.  
* If it's not very functional, users cannot see what it does.  
* But if it's not transparent, other developers cannot see how it does it.
* Developers are driven to make funky simulations that do impressive things.  
* That's great because it shows off what a simulation can do.
* But it creates a barrier to understanding, because users cannot become developers.  
* This is a fundamental contradiction.  
* Following Hegel it cannot be reconciled by a fundamental principle.  
* Following the Eleventh Thesis on Feuerbach, it should be achieved by the community itself.
* The point is to Code It.
